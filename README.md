## About

In this assignment I am trying to get familiar with databases.  
I am going to make a couple of those and try to extract and manipulate the data inside.  
When I am able to achieve this I'm going to try and use data between tables.  

---
## What's up?

### Step 1

Make the following tables and populate them with some dummy data (have at least two entries for every table)
1. groups: id, name, location, start_date, max_participants
2. learners: id, name, email, active
3. coaches: id, name

#### My examples: 
1.  
![1-groups](./images/1-group.png)
2.  
![1-learners](./images/1-learners.png)
3.  
![1-coaches](./images/1-coaches.png)

#### How did I create a table?

### Step 2

Try the following selects:
1. get all data from groups
2. Get the name and email of the first learner, and alias the name to learner_name

#### The console?

- Step 1 
![console](./images/2-console.png)  
  * The console is located on the top right
- Step 2 
![solution1](./images/consoleSolution1.png)
  * The first one gets all the data from "groups"
  * The second one gets the name and email from the first learner and changes the "name" to "learner name"

### Step 3

ðŸ’© happens - a group needs to be postponed
1. Update the start date of the first_group (make it two months later)
2. Introduce a new field status which can contain a long text indicating the reason for postponing
