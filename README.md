## About

In this assignment I am trying to get familiar with databases.  
I am going to make a couple of those and try to extract and manipulate the data inside.  
When I am able to achieve this I'm going to try and use data between tables.

## What's up?

### Step 1

Make the following tables and populate them with some dummy data (have at least two entries for every table)
1. groups: id, name, location, start_date, max_participants
2. learners: id, name, email, active
3. coaches: id, name

#### My examples: 
1.

3.
